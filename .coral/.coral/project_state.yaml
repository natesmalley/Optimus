    task: "# Architect Task for Optimus\n\nDesign the complete technical architecture\
      \ for Optimus - a Project Intelligence & Monetization Platform with these core\
      \ capabilities:\n\n## System Requirements:\n\n1. **Project Discovery & Monitoring**\n\
      \   - Auto-discover all projects in ~/projects directory\n   - Detect which\
      \ projects are currently running (processes, ports, containers)\n   - Analyze\
      \ tech stack, dependencies, and health status\n   - Monitor git activity and\
      \ collaboration\n\n2. **Intelligence & Analysis**\n   - Classify projects by\
      \ type, stage, and monetization potential\n   - Map dependencies between projects\n\
      \   - Assess technical debt and security vulnerabilities\n   - Identify performance\
      \ bottlenecks\n\n3. **Monetization Advisor**\n   - Analyze revenue potential\
      \ of each project\n   - Suggest business models (SaaS, licensing, consulting)\n\
      \   - Provide market alignment recommendations\n   - Calculate ROI projections\n\
      \n4. **Troubleshooting Assistant**\n   - Pattern recognition for common errors\n\
      \   - Cross-project solution learning\n   - Automated fix attempts\n   - Context-aware\
      \ recommendations\n\n5. **Future Voice Interface**\n   - Prepare architecture\
      \ for eventual Optimus Prime voice interaction\n   - NLP-ready command processing\n\
      \   - Conversational context management\n\n## Technical Constraints:\n- Must\
      \ handle 50+ projects efficiently\n- Real-time monitoring with minimal overhead\n\
      - Scalable to handle large codebases\n- Secure handling of sensitive project\
      \ data\n- API-first design for integrations\n\n## Deliverables Needed:\n1. System\
      \ architecture diagram (component relationships)\n2. Database schema design\n\
      3. API endpoint structure\n4. Service breakdown (microservices vs monolith decision)\n\
      5. Technology recommendations for each component\n6. Security architecture\n\
      7. Deployment strategy\n8. Development phases with milestones\n\nPlease provide\
      \ a comprehensive technical architecture that can start simple but scale to\
      \ support the full vision including future voice interaction."
