# Architect Task for Optimus

Design the complete technical architecture for Optimus - a Project Intelligence & Monetization Platform with these core capabilities:

## System Requirements:

1. **Project Discovery & Monitoring**
   - Auto-discover all projects in ~/projects directory
   - Detect which projects are currently running (processes, ports, containers)
   - Analyze tech stack, dependencies, and health status
   - Monitor git activity and collaboration

2. **Intelligence & Analysis**
   - Classify projects by type, stage, and monetization potential
   - Map dependencies between projects
   - Assess technical debt and security vulnerabilities
   - Identify performance bottlenecks

3. **Monetization Advisor**
   - Analyze revenue potential of each project
   - Suggest business models (SaaS, licensing, consulting)
   - Provide market alignment recommendations
   - Calculate ROI projections

4. **Troubleshooting Assistant**
   - Pattern recognition for common errors
   - Cross-project solution learning
   - Automated fix attempts
   - Context-aware recommendations

5. **Future Voice Interface**
   - Prepare architecture for eventual Optimus Prime voice interaction
   - NLP-ready command processing
   - Conversational context management

## Technical Constraints:
- Must handle 50+ projects efficiently
- Real-time monitoring with minimal overhead
- Scalable to handle large codebases
- Secure handling of sensitive project data
- API-first design for integrations

## Deliverables Needed:
1. System architecture diagram (component relationships)
2. Database schema design
3. API endpoint structure
4. Service breakdown (microservices vs monolith decision)
5. Technology recommendations for each component
6. Security architecture
7. Deployment strategy
8. Development phases with milestones

Please provide a comprehensive technical architecture that can start simple but scale to support the full vision including future voice interaction.
